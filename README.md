# Hypothesis-Testing
Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions.

Conclusion:

The null hypotheses which states that the two groups are the same is rejected by a t-test (comparing the means of the 2 groups consisting of university- and non-university towns respectively) with the p-value of 0.009.
There is thus a 0.9 percent chance that the two groups are the same (it is extremely unlikely).

The alternative hypothesis can thus safely be assumed,
and university towns experienced smaller declines in housing prices during the 2008-2009 recession compared to non-university towns.
